# PhpStorm-LaracastsTheme

First off, this theme is based on the Laracasts theme, so all credit goes to Jeffrey Way. I love the #Laracasts PhpStorm theme and couldn't find anything that matched it, so I decided to do it myself.

Hope others find this useful as well. Cheers!


# Mac Users

 - Download the LaracastsTheme.icls file.
 - Navigate to ~/Library/Preferences/WebIde*/colors (note: The * depends on your version of PhpStorm. If you're using PhpStorm 8, then the folder is WebIde80)
 - Paste the file (LaracastsTheme.icls) here. Restart PhpStorm if it's already open.
 - Next, press 'ctrl + ~' to bring up the theme selector and choose LaracastsTheme from the menu.
 
I do not do dev work on a windows computer, but I'm sure the folder structure for windows users will be the same. Do hunt around Google if you need any assisstance.
